# Intro
Where2Study aims to ease the process of finding areas to study and providing a convenient platform to find other students and form study groups. This app will help to relieve some of the stress of studying on campus and hopefully improve the experience a student has when trying to study for their next exam.  

# Login Credentials:
Email: where2studytester@gmail.com   Password:  welovegary123 \
This is the login credentials to a gmail account. Typically you would not be able to register an account that is not a UCSD email, however so that the tester does not need to use a personal email to test the reset password link. If the test makes new accounts they must use an @ucsd.edu eamil, though it does not need to be a real one, unless the user wishes to use the recover email option.
(Tester should feel free and is encouraged to make make at least one more account with a UCSD email to test the registration process, accept their own posts made from the other account)
