# Contains the code for the modals used in the Screen Sequence Diagrams!
The files are called:
SampleViewRequest.js
SampleCreateRequest.js
SampleEditRequest.js

There is a bit more info within the files themselves, but essentially the modals and the fields
will still need to be implemented into the website itself, but it has the layout of each one
completed for you to import. Let me know if you have any questions and sorry if the code is crappy
and messy.
